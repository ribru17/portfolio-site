# Portfolio Website

A web portfolio of myself made by myself to showcase what I can do.
[Visit the site here](https://ribru17.github.io/portfolio-site)

## Running

To run this project clone it and then run `npm start` in the cloned directory. This will only run the client - you don't need to worry about
the server as it is hosted separately on Render.com.

## Server

The Express server is hosted on Render.com and its repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/ribru17/portfolio-site-backend)
For my purposes the server is just a simple endpoint that e-mails me the content of the `Contact` page form.
