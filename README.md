# Portfolio Website

A web portfolio of myself made by myself to showcase what I can do.

## Running

To run this project clone it and then run `npm start` in the cloned directory. This will run the client and you don't need to worry about
the server as it is hosted separately on Heroku.

## Server

The server is hosted on Heroku as I ran into some troubles trying to bundle the client and server together. For my purposes
the server is just a simple endpoint that e-mails me the content of the `Contact` page.
